# Giovanni Onorato - Thesis
## Use of SuperCollider in a live performance with assisted composition

This is the code i wrote for my Bachelor's degree final exam at [Conservatorio G.B. Martini](http://www.consbo.it/home) in Bologna, happened on the 20th of June 2020. My thesis Supervisor was [Damiano Meacci](https://www.baruffi.com/).

This code is meant to be launched in SC running via Jack so to have the possibility to use Ableton Live in parallel in order to perform with the structure generated and played by the code.

You can find here one of the possible musical outcomes: [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=192556565515997&ref=external) and [audio only](https://www.spreaker.com/user/usma_radio/sonoravirus-giovanni-onorato?utm_medium=widget&utm_source=user%3A8877612&utm_term=episode_title) (better quality).
